Type 'make' to build the library. Remember to have libgtk+ headers installed.

To install copy the files 'notes-wrapper' and 'libnotesgtkfix.so' to the
location of the 'notes' binary. For me it is in /opt/ibm/lotus/notes, but
for you it might be different.

Now fire up Lotus Notes with the 'notes-wrapper'-script instead of 'notes'.
