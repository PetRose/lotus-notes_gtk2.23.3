Type 'make' to build the library. Remember to have libgtk+ headers installed.

On Ubuntu the required libraries can be installed by running the following
command.

   $ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

On 64bit Ubuntu g++-multilib also needs to be installed.

   $ sudo apt-get install g++-multilib

To install copy the files 'notes-wrapper' and 'libnotesgtkfix.so' to the
location of the 'notes' binary. For me it is in /opt/ibm/lotus/notes, but
for you it might be different.

Now fire up Lotus Notes with the 'notes-wrapper'-script instead of 'notes'.

With the current version of Lotus Notes (8.5.2) on linux the systemwide
desktop-files is at /usr/share/applications/LotusNotes8.5.desktop. Editing that
files changing the shortcut there, will make notes run for all local users.
