Recent versions of Ubuntu and most likely all other distributions package
GTK 2.23.3 ir higher. That version contains an optimization that somehow
breaks Lotus Notes making it unable to draw things correctly on the screen.
Things tend to get drawn as gray areas instead of real content. This
software works around that problem.

Prerequisites
-------------
On Ubuntu the required libraries can be installed by running the following
command.

   $ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

On 64bit Ubuntu g++-multilib also needs to be installed.

   $ sudo apt-get install g++-multilib


Installation
------------
Run 'make' to build the library. Remember to have all the required libraries
installed. Then run 'sudo make install' to install the files and modify the
desktop-file. You can now run Lotus Notes from application-menu on your desktop.


Manual installation
-------------------
To install copy the files 'notes-wrapper' and 'libnotesgtkfix.so' to the
location of the 'notes' binary. For me it is in /opt/ibm/lotus/notes, but
for you it might be different.

Now fire up Lotus Notes with the 'notes-wrapper'-script instead of 'notes'.

With the current version of Lotus Notes (8.5.2) on linux the systemwide
desktop-files is at /usr/share/applications/LotusNotes8.5.desktop. Editing that
files changing the shortcut there, will make notes run for all local users.
